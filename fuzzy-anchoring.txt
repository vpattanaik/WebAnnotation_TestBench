These are the selectors saved:

    RangeSelector: this what we had we had until now: a pair (for start and end) of XPaths pointing to the DOM elements, and the string offsets inside them.
    TextPositionSelector: this is a pair of string offsets, marking the start and end of the selected text in the character string representing the whole document.
    TextQuoteSelector: this selector stores three strings:
        exact: the selected text itself
        prefix: the (32-char long) text immediately before the selected text
        suffix: the (32-char long) text immediately after the selected text
